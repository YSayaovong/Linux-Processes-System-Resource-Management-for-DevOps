## Introduction

This project is focused on understanding and managing Linux processes, system resource allocation, and optimization techniques that are essential for DevOps. It provides practical examples of system monitoring, process management, and performance tuning for ensuring efficient system operations in a Linux environment.

## Features

- Detailed scripts for managing Linux processes.
- Examples on using Linux tools like `top`, `htop`, `ps`, `vmstat`, and `iostat` for system resource management.
- Automated scripts for monitoring resource usage.
- Tutorials and documentation for beginners to advanced users in DevOps.

## Scripts and Examples

### Process Management

- **Process Listing and Monitoring**: Scripts using `ps`, `top`, and `htop` to list and monitor active processes, identify resource hogs, and analyze process behavior.
- **Kill and Terminate Processes**: Example scripts for terminating processes safely using commands like `kill` and `pkill`.
- **Background Jobs**: Managing background and foreground jobs, including practical examples using `&`, `fg`, `bg`, and `jobs` commands.

### System Resource Management

- **CPU and Memory Monitoring**: Examples using `vmstat`, `free`, and `iostat` to monitor CPU and memory usage in real-time.
- **Disk Usage Analysis**: Using `df`, `du`, and `iostat` to determine disk space and I/O bottlenecks.
- **Resource Limits**: Scripts for setting and managing user and system resource limits with `ulimit` and `/etc/security/limits.conf`.

## Technologies Used

- **Linux Tools**: `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, `df`, `du`
- **Shell Scripting**: Bash scripts for automation of routine tasks
- **System Resource Management**: Techniques and tools for optimizing CPU, memory, and disk usage

## Getting Started

To use the scripts in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YSayaovong/Linux-Processes-System-Resource-Management-for-DevOps.git
    cd Linux-Processes-System-Resource-Management-for-DevOps
    ```
2. **Run the Scripts**:
    - Make the scripts executable: 
      ```sh
      chmod +x script_name.sh
      ```
    - Execute the script:
      ```sh
      ./script_name.sh
      ```
